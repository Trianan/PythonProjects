BEST-Bot (Version 1.2) by: Trianan (March 17/2021)

What does it do?:

  	  This bot checks if an item is in stock on BestBuy.ca 
	by clicking the "add to cart" button in order to see if 
	the button is active; if the button is active the item 
	will be added to a cart, the program will send an email to 
	everyone on the recipient-list, and close. If the button 
	is inactive, the program will not email anyone. The Chrome
	browser the program will use runs in windowless-mode, such 
	that system resources aren't used by graphically rendering
	the web page and the browser window doesn't become a 
	distraction. This program is meant to be set as a repeating
	task in the Task-Scheduler, where the batch file included is
	the program meant to be run.
