TO-DO:

- Collisions to be implemented for platforms, in order to cancel falling and movement into them. (Collisions with top
    of platforms implemented. Needs side collisions cancelling horizontal movement.)

- Need to create and implement win object for levels, and progression through levels.

- Create more levels. Maybe more mechanics like spikes or enemies.

- If planning on implementing background art, need to figure out how to implement sprites that allow transparency,
    such as .png format.

- Add sounds via mixer.

- Implementing main menu and pause menu.

- Needs proper title.

- Major refactoring and cleanup throughout process of project.

- Need to create a system for smooth jumping. Either downward acceleration that cancels out upward movement speed,
    or some other method. Method similar to horizontal deceleration could be used. *DONE* (Buggy)

- Player needs to be moved with platform when on top *DONE*.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

BUGS:

- Player sinks into platforms when landing on them.

- If both horizontal-movement keys are held down and one is released, the player does not move in the direction
    of the key that is still being held, and remains in place.

- Player is launched vertically when jumping and colliding under a platform.

- Player does not start in bottom-center of screen. *FIXED*

- Player now moves very slowly to the left when both keys held down. *FIXED*

- The current system of accelerating movement allows an exploit that enables the player to stack acceleration
    by quickly alternating movement keys in a certain fashion. *FIXED*

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTES:

- The acceleration stacking could maybe get reworked into a proper game mechanic, it's kinda fun and makes the movement
    more interesting.
